                <h3>Mindforge Academy</h3>
                <p>Having learnt from private tutors from primary through to secondary school, then onto sixth form, and then onto being a private tutor myself, I came to the realisation that good tutors are overly expensive and cheap tutors are severely underqualified. In order to bridge this gap, I decided to launch my own tuition company, aimed at offering premium GCSE and A-Level Maths tuition 1-1 at more affordable prices; high quality tuition for affordability. </p>

                <h3>Content Creator @inanfida on tiktok</h3>
                <p>What started off as a hobby has become a part time career for me, creating content on tiktok on my own personal page, where I provide nuanced discussions over a range of topics including but not limited to education, entertainment and culture. Through mastery of SEO, I have managed to acheive over 30k+ followers, and worked with multiple brands, of which some are well known. These include Firmoo, Trainpal, Trip.com. I look to expand my exploits on social media to further build my personal brand. </p>
